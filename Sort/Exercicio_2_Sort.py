'''
list_ofwords = []: This line simply the list of words to be sorted

def compare_words(...): This is a custom function that determines the order of two items

word1_lower = word1.lower(): To ignore case, the function converts both words to lowercase before comparing them

return word1_lower< word2_lower: Its to flip the logic. If word1 is alphabetical less than word, the function return rue. This tells the sorting algorithm that the words are in the wrong order and need to be swapped

n = len(list_of_words): The variable n stores the total number of words in the list, used to control the loop

for j in range (n): This is the outer loop of the bubble sort. It ensures the algorithm makes enough passes to fully sort the list.

for j in range (0, n-i-1): This is the inner loop. In each pass, it compares every pair of adjacent words. The n-i-1 part is small optimization to avoid re-checking elements that have been sorted already

if compare_words(list_of_words[j], list_of_words[j+1]): this is the swap condition. If the custom comparison functions returns true, the swap is executed

list_of_words[j], list_of_words [j+1] = list_of_words[j+1], list_of_words[j]: This line effecientlly swaps the positions of the words. The larger element bubbles into itsd correct place  in the list wich each pass.

print(list_of_words): Is just the result of the sorted list
